Digital Mind Robotics is my portfolio and blog where I share my thoughts on the latest trends in technology and details of the projects I am working on.  Through my professional experience, I have worked on some incredible projects but I also enjoy building things as a hobby and utilizing technology in creative ways.  My primary technologies are Python, C/C++ and Robotic Operating System [(ROS)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html).  I am currently learning Tensorflow and RTOS.  Contact me to collaborate on cool projects.

## About this website

This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  Hugo is a simple solution for building websites which allows for the creator to focus on content.  It is perfect for creating a blog or a portfolio.  This website uses the [Hugo Learn](https://learn.netlify.app/en/) theme.  Building a website with Hugo consists of installing and selecting a theme.  The selected theme can be modified.  Adding content is done by writing pages in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which is much more efficient than traditional methods.  The logo for my site was generated using AI at [BrandCrowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/).
